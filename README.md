# diary2
Just a diary, literally. But here are some features:
- on new year's eve, get access to data insights on your journal entries regarding genre classification, sentiment and other less cool things.
- 'message in a bottle' feature. Choose to share your journal entry with someone random. You'll get notified where and who opens it.
- Set how long you want to 'lock' your entries. So you don't look back at it the day after.
- Oh. and you need a google account to use this.

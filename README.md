# diaryia ' die - ur - ee - uh '
Just a diary, literally. But some features I wanted but couldn't find anywhere :(
- on new year's eve, get access to data insights on your journal entries regarding genre classification, sentiment and other less cool things.
- Set how long you want to 'lock' your entries. So you don't look back at it the day after.
- Oh. and you need a google account to use this.
